# medical-dispenser
This project aims to design and implement a medicine dispenser using VHDL. A medicine dispenser is a device that can store and dispense different types of pills or capsules according to a preset schedule. The device can help patients to take their medications correctly and avoid overdosing or missing doses. The device can also provide security and convenience for the users and pharmacists.

The main components of the medicine dispenser are:

- A storage unit that can hold multiple containers of pills or capsules.
- A dispensing unit that can drop the containers into a vial when the user scans their fingerprint.
- A control unit that can communicate with a PC application and a micro-controller to manage the dispensing schedule and user verification.
- A VHDL code that can program the FPGA to control the dispensing logic and the servo motors.

The project will use low cost materials and components to achieve scalability and efficiency. The project will also test the counting accuracy and reliability of the device with different types of pills or capsules. The project will compare the performance of the device with existing machines in the market.
